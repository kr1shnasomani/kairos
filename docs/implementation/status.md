## Headline

**All 13 architecture layers are implemented — the *product* is complete.** What remains is
**deployment, ops, and optional polish** (public hosting, manual E2E, security hardening) —
tracked in [Pending](#pending--deployment-ops--polish-as-of-2026-07-18) below.

KAIROS has **no connection to a live industrial plant** (no OSIsoft PI historian,
no SAP/Maximo EAM, single-site). Those integration points therefore run on
mock/fixture data **by design** — that is the intended, delivered MVP state, not
an unfinished task. The mock adapters are real code with a documented one-line
switch to go live *if* a plant is ever connected; until then, the mock **is** the
product.

## Layer completion

| # | Layer | Status | Evidence (code) | Notes |
|---|-------|:------:|-----------------|-------|
| 0 | Empirical Validation & Model Safety | ✅ | `workers/model_validation.py`, `services/circuit_breaker.py`, `validation_corpus`, `/governance/model-gate/*`, `/governance/validation-corpus/stats` | — |
| 1 | Deterministic Identity & MDM Backbone | ✅ | `/assets` (`MERGE`, `identity_confirmed_by` required), `asset_alias_map`, `services/graph.py` | EAM asset bootstrap = Go-connector **fixture** (no SAP/Maximo) — mock by design |
| 2 | Immutable Evidence Vault | ✅ | Supabase Storage (`kairos-vault`), SHA-256 dedup, `documents`, `POST /documents/ingest` | — |
| 3 | Multimodal Perception Engine | ✅ | OCR (NIM Nemotron), NER (NIM ministral), voice (Groq Whisper), annotations, **P&ID topology** (`services/pid.py`, NIM `llama-3.2-11b-vision`) | Path A (custom YOLO+LayoutLM on GPU) = optional future accuracy upgrade, `requirements-cv.txt` |
| 4 | Temporal Reality Graph | ✅ | Neo4j, `KNOWLEDGE_EDGE` (6 props), `as_of` time-travel, blast-radius, conflict detection | — |
| 5 | Zero-Copy OT Virtualization | 🟦 | Go connector `/ot/query`, `/ot/coverage` (`MockHistorianClient`) | **Mock by design — no plant historian.** Real path (`PIWebAPIClient`) is built; set `PI_WEBAPI_BASE_URL` to go live. OPC-UA is a stub. |
| 6 | Quarantine Knowledge Layer | ✅ | `quarantine_items` one-way gate, `/governance/quarantine` promote / dispute / request-info | — |
| 7 | Dual-Track Governance & Adjudication | ✅ | `knowledge_conflicts` (track), MoC webhook, SLA escalation (`services/sla_service.py`), circuit breaker, blast-radius | — |
| 8 | Operational Event & Proactive Delivery | ✅ | 8 event sources (`/events/*`), Redis Streams, EEMUA governor (`services/event_bus.py`), `services/brief_engine.py`, plant-state suppression, late-arrival + correlation | — |
| 9 | Structured Knowledge Elicitation | ✅ | `MicroInterviewWorkflow` (Neo4j + LLM, `workflows/elicitation_workflow.py`), off-boarding programmes | — |
| 10 | Telemetry-Grounded Outcome Attribution | 🟨 | `workers/attribution.py` (3-check logic), triggered from `POST /events/work-order` | Full attribution logic; its telemetry-baseline check reads the Layer-5 **mock** historian by design (no plant). Live logic, mock sensor input. |
| 11 | Reasoning & Synthesis | ✅ | Hybrid search (`services/search_service.py`), `/search/synthesize`, `/search/rca-pack`, safety refusal (NIM `llama-3.1-70b` + Jina embed) | — |
| 12 | Phased Deployment, Trust & Point-of-Action Interface | ✅ | Next.js frontend (36 tasks), `PhaseBadge`, field mode, all routes | Cross-site advisories are fixture-only (single-site MVP, by design). UI polish/depth is an ongoing frontend track. |

**Score: 12 ✅ live + 1 🟨 live-on-mock + Layer 5 🟦 mock-by-design.** Every layer is
implemented; the only non-real data paths are the external-plant integrations, which
are mock **by design**.

---

## Mock-by-design (final — not pending)

These are mock/fixture because the real counterpart is an **external system KAIROS
does not own**, or an enterprise scale-out beyond the single-site MVP. With no plant
to connect to, these are the delivered state:

| Item | Where | To go live (if a plant is ever connected) |
|------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| OT historian (PI Web API) | `connectors/internal/ot/client.go` | set `PI_WEBAPI_BASE_URL` + creds (`PIWebAPIClient` already built) |
| OT historian (OPC-UA) | `connectors/internal/ot/client.go` | implement `gopcua` read (stub) |
| EAM asset sync (SAP/Maximo) | `connectors/internal/eam/client.go` | set `EAM_ODS_ENDPOINT` + implement SAP ODS query (stub) |
| Cross-site pattern advisories | `frontend .../management/cross-site` | multi-site control-plane feed |

---

## Optional future enhancements (not pending, not required)

| Enhancement | Trigger to build it |
|-------------|---------------------|
| P&ID Path A — custom YOLOv9 + LayoutLMv3 on GPU (`requirements-cv.txt`) | Higher extraction accuracy + a labelled P&ID dataset + GPU node |
| Per-recommendation attribution drill-down (Layer 10) | Deep Layer-10 analytics beyond the current summary |
| Frontend UI depth / polish (Demo-vs-Full cuts in `FE.md`) | The ongoing frontend track |

None of these block the platform; it is fully functional without them.

## Pending — deployment, ops & polish (as of 2026-07-18)

> **The product (all 13 layers) is complete.** These are **operational / hosting / polish** tasks that

### Deployment (critical path — nothing is publicly live yet)
- [ ] **Deploy the backend** to an EC2 box: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile prod up` with **Caddy** for HTTPS. *(The Vercel-hosted frontend is non-functional until this exists.)*
- [ ] **Set prod env** on the box: `APP_ENV=production` (activates the fail-closed secret guardrail) + real `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `APP_SECRET_KEY` in `.env`.
- [ ] **Wire the frontend → backend:** set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (Vercel or the box) + add that origin to backend `CORS_ORIGINS`. *(Alternative: serve the frontend from the same EC2 box via Caddy — same-origin, no CORS.)*
- [ ] **Neo4j Aura keep-alive:** cron-job.org (daily) → `/health/detailed`, so Aura doesn't pause after 3 days idle.
- [ ] **AWS billing alarm (~$30)** so the $120 credit isn't overrun.

### Security
- [ ] **Triage Dependabot alerts** — GitHub flagged 79 (10 critical) on last push; review the criticals.
- [ ] **Add CodeQL** workflow once the repo is public.

### Testing
- [ ] **Manual end-to-end walkthrough** — click every page as `admin`, then as `field_worker` to confirm the role gate redirects. (Guide: FRONTEND.md navigation + this file.)
- [ ] **Test-suite hygiene:** run the write-heavy suite ONLY against `--profile local-stores` or in CI — never against cloud (the teardown purge is unreliable on cloud Supabase and pollutes the golden data). Optionally add the 7 secrets `tests.yml` needs.

### Frontend polish (optional)
- [ ] **Friendly copilot shell** — warm greeting + "what can you do?" handling + suggestion chips (keeps the governed-RAG core; only improves the conversational wrapper).
- [ ] **Verify the safety-critical RefusalCard** live in the UI.

### Housekeeping (optional)
- [ ] **Import the 2 Grafana dashboard JSONs** (`infra/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/*.json`) into Grafana Cloud so hosted dashboards match what was built.
- [ ] **Decide on the 4 dead infra configs** (`infra/otel`, `infra/tempo`, grafana datasources/provisioning) — delete for a clean tree or keep as a record (labeled in INFRA.md §8 either way).
- [ ] **CI gating** (fail a PR on retrieval/provenance/layer regression) — deferred; only the deterministic metrics are safe to gate.

## Verification snapshot (2026-07-18)

- Backend test suite: **~175 passed · 3 skipped** (1 transient flake; passes in isolation). Frontend: **124 passed**.
- Benchmark (cloud stores): retrieval **25/25**, answer **23/25**, provenance **25/25**, entity-F1 **~0.96**.
- P&ID Path B: live-validated on `dataset/02_Document_Corpus/pid_line3_isolation_boundary.png`.
- **Cloud stores:** Neo4j Aura + Qdrant Cloud + Supabase + Grafana Cloud (observability). Default local stack ≈ 13 containers (neo4j/qdrant/grafana/tempo/otel offloaded); ~2–3 GB idle RAM.
- Auth verified-token cache: ~577 ms/request saved (revocation preserved, ≤ TTL staleness).
